Project1:  Four Plotting Scripts and Associated 'png' Files
========================================================

The files in this repo consist of two types: script files(plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R)
and four plot files (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png) required for Project 1 of the "Data Science Specialization: Exploratory Data Analyis"

The first script (plot1.r) downloads the required data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip" and extracts the data from the zip file into the current working directory.

The script loads the data into 'R' from "household_power_consumption.txt".

A subset of data is selected for the dates '2007-02-01' and '2007-02-02' only and stores it in a separate 'csv' file in the working directory for use in the other plot scripts so the data is only downloaded once.  This subset of the household power data is contained in "household_power_consumption_February.csv".

plot1.R produces plot1 and saves it as plot1.png.   
plot2.R produces plot2 and saves it as plot2.png.   
plot3.R produces plot3 and saves it as plot3.png.   
plot4.R produces plot4 and saves it as plot4.png.
